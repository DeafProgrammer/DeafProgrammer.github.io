# Better Than Before

## 🥸 The Four Tendencies

I am used to being an upholder, but I am now a questioner. I studied at university 🎒 for many years. I always met deadlines and maintained good grades 🍎, but recently I have started to stop caring because I have accumulated so many credits that it hardly affects my GPA 🧠. I found it hard to avoid feeling stressed until I stopped feeling stressed . However, I also developed the bad habit of becoming obsessed with getting good grades. I also love solving problems. Once I start analysing something, I can't stop. I even overthink that. 😵

## 🦉 Am I a lark or an owl?

When I was at my previous university, I was a night owl 🦉. I had several projects, which meant that I often had to work 📜 through the night to avoid falling behind or failing the course. Most assignments were always due the next day ⏰. The stress was incredible. Some courses involved two hours of lectures 🧑‍🏫. I have now transferred to Friends University, where I have found things much easier. This is especially true since the lectures are only 50 minutes long! I am glad that I can sleep 💤 in for eight hours. I've become a lark.

## 🛸 Am I a marathoner, a sprinter, or a procrastinator?

I am a procrastinator, obviously, because the last minute is a nightmare for me. A project in the field of software development 🧑‍💻 is something that takes several months to complete. The last minute is never acceptable. Technologies are constantly changing. I have to keep learning 🤯 how to use them. So, time is never on my side.

## 💰 Am I an underbuyer or an overbuyer?

That would make me an underbuyer. I only purchase an item when it is absolutely necessary or as a reward 🎉 for my hard work. I always research items first to check that the price is reasonable. For example, I once found two laptops 💻 with the same hardware components but very different prices 💵.
