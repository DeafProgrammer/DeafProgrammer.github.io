# Better Than Before

## The Four Tendencies

I am used to being an upholder, but I am now a questioner. I studied at university for many years. I always met deadlines and maintained good grades, but recently I have started to stop caring because I have accumulated so many credits that it hardly affects my GPA. I found it hard to avoid feeling stressed until I stopped feeling stressed. However, I also developed the bad habit of becoming obsessed with getting good grades. I also love solving problems. Once I start analysing something, I can't stop. I even overthink that.

## Am I a lark or an owl?

When I was at my previous university, I was a night owl. I had several projects, which meant that I often had to work through the night to avoid falling behind or failing the course. Most assignments were always due the next day. The stress was incredible. Some courses involved two hours of lectures. I have now transferred to Friends University, where I have found things much easier. This is especially true since the lectures are only 50 minutes long! I am glad that I can sleep in for eight hours. I've become a lark.
