  👋 Hello World! I am James Anderson. As you know that I am born deaf. Some of you may be wondering whether I think in sign language or in words. The answer is... sign language. 🤘

  You've obviously noticed that I created this website. 😵‍💫 You can probably tell that I study Computer Systems and Information Systems. I have been studying IT for over three years. I have two Associate of Applied Science degrees: one in accounting and one in mobile app development. 🎓 Soon, I will have a Bachelor's degree! 🎉 Over time, I have developed my own skills and habits. I did actually make Discord bots and a full-stack app for a small gaming community. Creating an app takes a lot of time. ⏳😅
