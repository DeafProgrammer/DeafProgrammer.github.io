# Spiritual Personality

## 🧐 Intellectual

When I was young, my family and I used to go to church ⛪. There was no interpreter at the church. I was unable to learn about Christianity ✝️. I knew nothing about God until I learned how to read and write. At a public school, children have not been taught how to communicate with me. As a result, I focused on my education just to pass the time. I studied really hard. As time went on, I leaned more towards science 🧪 than religion. I had rational questions about Christianity and God. Over the course of the past eight weeks, I have been reading the book 📖 "Letters from a Skeptic". Edward asked great rational questions about whether God is all-powerful and loving when the world is full of suffering. Gregory's answers were the best I had ever heard compared to those of other people I had met who talked about God. It was as if Gregory had dispelled some of my doubts about God and Christianity. He made it more sensible and logical.

## 😼 Contemplative & Naturalist 🍁

I absolutely love wandering through a forest at night when it's cold. ⛄ There's nothing quite like it, it's so peaceful and calm. There is a complete absence of activity or movement. I am less aware of my surroundings. Furthermore, during the full moon 🌕, I was able to see far distances. There are also stars ⭐, which add a special touch to the night sky. I did this a few times because I was very alone at my previous university in New York as I didn't know anyone there. I had to stay alert the whole time, which was exhausting. 😮‍💨
